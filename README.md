### Hi! I'm Sofía Aritz

**I don't usually come here often.** I usually publish projects on my [personal git server](https://git.sofiaritz.com/sofia) or on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/sofiaritz). I made this GitHub account to be able to open issues, make PRs to project hosted here and things like that.
